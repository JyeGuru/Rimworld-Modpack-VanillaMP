Basic Setup:
- Create config.json using the example file provided
- Edit config.json with the paths to your game folder and mods folder. These can be Steam or DRM-Free based.
- Put your ModsConfig.xml into .\Config\Config (or use the example provided)
- Put any other files (scenarios/saves/etc) into the relevant .\Config folders
- Run UpdateGame.cmd to bring the game files over (or manually copy them into the .\Game folder)
- Run UpdateMods.cmd to bring the mod files over (or manually copy them into the .\Game\Mods folder)
- Run Run.cmd to load the game and test the setup, also configure mod settings
- Quit the game to ensure all files are saved correctly
- Run Generate.cmd to package up the files for distribution

Manual Install:
- Somehow distribute the four 7z files generated in the Packages folder
- Unzip them somewhere (all into the same root)
- Run Run.cmd to load the game and play!

Manual Update:
- Somehow distribute the four updated 7z files generated in the Packages folder
- Put them into the Updates folder where the game is currently installed
- Run Update.cmd

Configure Autoupdates:
- Take the four 7z files and upload them somewhere you can get a direct download link to them
- Create .\Scripts\Updates\update.json with the permalinks (see example)
- Re-run Generate.cmd to update the Scripts.7z package and the autoupdate.zip
- Replace your uploaded Scripts.7z with the new one (keeping the same permalink!)

AutoUpdate Install:
- Somehow distribute the autoupdate.zip file
- Unzip it into a folder somewhere
- Run Update.cmd

AutoUpdate Update:
- Generate and replace the uploaded 7z files with the new ones (keeping the same permalinks!)
- Run Update.cmd on the clients

NOTE ON ONEDRIVE:
I use OneDrive for hosting these files, which works perfectly. However it's a bit of a pain to get the direct download URLs.
- Put the files in a OneDrive folder somewhere
- Wait for them to sync
- Right-click in the folder and "View Online"
- In the web interface, repeat the below steps for each one (only tested in Chrome/New Edge)
- Right-Click, Share
- Change options to "Anyone with the link can view" and "Copy Link"
- Open an incognito tab and paste the link, this will download the file
- In the Downloads panel (Ctrl-J) right-click and copy the URL of the downloaded file: This is the one you need!
